### End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline Project

**Project Overview:**
The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline capable of handling data ingestion, transformation, model training, and evaluation for both regression and classification tasks. Additionally, a user-friendly web application has been developed to facilitate predictions based on the trained models. The entire pipeline has been deployed to ensure accessibility and scalability.

**Skills and Deliverables:**
- Data Analysis
- Git
- Azure DevOps
- Bash
- Linux
- Machine Learning Model
- Python
- Flask

**Solution Components:**

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline:**
   - Responsible for ingesting data from various sources and formats.
   - Implements data validation, integrity checks, and cleaning processes to ensure data quality.

2. **Data Transformation Module:**
   - Provides a flexible environment for transforming raw data into a format suitable for model training.
   - Incorporates feature engineering techniques, data scaling, encoding, and normalization.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation Pipeline:**
   - Implements machine learning algorithms suitable for regression and classification tasks.
   - Designs a pipeline for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.

4. **Web Application Development:**
   - Developed a user-friendly web application using Flask for model predictions.
   - Deployed the application on Azure Web Apps.
   - Implemented monitoring, logging, and security measures to ensure reliability and data integrity.
   - Enabled Continuous Integration through Github actions.

This project showcases a robust machine learning pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment, leveraging various technologies and methodologies to ensure efficient and scalable machine learning solutions. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
